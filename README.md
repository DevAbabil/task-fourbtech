# FourBtech Frontend Developer Intern Task

This project was developed as part of the **Frontend Developer Intern Evaluation Process** for **FourBtech**.  
It converts a **Figma design** into a fully responsive and interactive **Next.js application**, focusing on **clean code structure**, **component reusability**, and **UI/UX precision**.

# Task Overview

**Goal:**  
Recreate the official [Figma Design](https://www.figma.com/design/DFq0Lik1RmSrsRNd57e7BS/fintech-landing-page?node-id=0-1&t=7hsL99silHvHEIBv-1) as a responsive and user-friendly landing page using modern frontend tools.

**Backend:**  
Not required.

**Tech Stack:**

- Next.js – React-based framework
- Tailwind CSS – utility-first styling
- ShadCN/UI – for accessible, consistent components
- Framer Motion – for smooth UI animations
- Bun – package manager and runtime
- Vercel – for deployment

## Implementation Overview

### 1. Project Setup

- Initialized with **Next.js** and configured **Tailwind CSS** using **Bun**.
- Installed and configured **ShadCN/UI** for elegant and reusable components.
